Jax/Flax implementation of BYOL, SimCLR, Convolutional Autoencoder.

* With this Jax/Flax implemented Semi-supervised model, you can generate general representation of music.
* We achieve decent result on the genre classification for kakao arena dataset with Semi-supervised model.
* You can compare accuarcy for 3 pretrain method with this repository.

* As a first method, we use latent vector of Autoencoder to create general representation.
* You can run
